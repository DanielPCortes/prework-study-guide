# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a Prework Study Guide that was created for not only boot camp students who were going through the Prework but, for myself as well, as I am one of said students. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. These notes are can be useful for beginner developers and veteran developers who want a refresher on the four aformentioned languages.

## Usage

As for the usage of this application, it can be used for many things. As previously stated in the Description, it could be used by beginner and veteran developers alike to gain information about the four languages/programs or just refresh their information on the topics. Another use of the application is within the DevTools console. If opened in the browser, we could see that the JavaScript file is running well. This JavaScript file lists the topics that are learned from the prework and allows us the choose which one we want to learn about. All-in-all the application is very useful for developers of all skill levels and is fairly simple to access.
